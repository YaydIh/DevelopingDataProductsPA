  This page has three tabbed output panels: 
    'Overview', 'Directions', & 'Plots'

  'Overview', this panel, describes the project.
  'Directions' describes the interaction between
     input controls and Plots.
  'Plots' displays the 2014 NOPD calls for 
     service regarding: Wreckless Driving and 
     Driving While Under Influence

  As part of program of tranparency, the New
  Orleans Police Department makes data available
  for Calls for Service.  For this class project I
  got the data from 2014 and focus on call
  regarding Wreckless Driving and Driving While
  Under Influence.  Among the data for each call
  is a data and time the call was created.  This
  project allows the user to select days of the
  week and compare the density of calls for each
  hour of the day occurint on those days.

  'Plots' contains three graphs.  Each graph has
  two elements.  The first element is a histogram
  of the density function of call broken down by
  the hour of the day.  Overlayed on each
  histogram are three smoothed curves
  representation of the density function, one for
  each of the three histograms.  The Blue
  histogram is the complete data set and remains
  unchanged in response to user input.  The Red
  and Green histrograms respond the user input in
  the section labelled, respectively, 'Red Graph'
  and 'Green Graph'.  The user controls allow the
  user to choose which days of the week to include
  in the graph.
